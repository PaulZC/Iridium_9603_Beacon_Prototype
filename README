# Paul Clark's Iridium 9603 Beacon #
####################################

Design and code for a prototype Iridium 9603 Beacon
Suitable for high altitude ballooning and other applications

Sends GPS location, pressure (altitude), temperature and battery voltage as Short Burst Data messages

Hardware is based on the Adafuit Feather Adalogger M0 + Ultimate GPS + MPL3115A2
The 9603 is mounted on a Satelligent 9603-DIP
Power for the 9603 is provided by a Linear Technology LTC3225 Supercapacitor Charger

You can find a photo of the prototype in "Iridium_9603_Beacon_Prototype.pdf", together
with links for the components

The wiring is shown more clearly in "Iridium_9603_Beacon_Prototype_Fritzing.pdf"

"Iridium_9603_Beacon_Prototype_Battery_Test.png" shows how well the system behaves running off
a 1000mAh LiPo cell. Sending once per hour, the battery should last approx. a month.

"Iridium_9603_Beacon_Mass_Budget.pdf" shows that it should be possible to get the mass down to ~70g
with a dedicated circuit board. Designing one is the next job on the things-to-do list.

"IridiumSBDBeacon.ino" contains code that seems to work very nicely.
You can adjust the message timing (BEACON_INTERVAL) to suit your needs.

Based on Mikal Hart's IridiumSBD Beacon example: https://github.com/mikalhart/IridiumSBD
Requires Mikal's TinyGPS library: https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPS
and PString: http://arduiniana.org/libraries/pstring/

GPS data provided by Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout or Ultimate GPS FeatherWing
https://www.adafruit.com/products/746
https://www.adafruit.com/products/3133
(Don't fit the CR1220 back-up battery. VBAT is provided by the Adalogger 3V rail.)
Pressure (altitude) and temperature provided by Sparkfun MPL3115A2 Breakout
https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11084
The Adafruit MPL3115A2 Breakout will work too
https://www.adafruit.com/products/1893
Requires Adafruit's MPL3115A2 library
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MPL3115A2_Library

Uses RTCZero to provide sleep functionality (on the M0)

With grateful thanks to CaveMoa for his SimpleSleepUSB example
https://github.com/cavemoa/Feather-M0-Adalogger
https://github.com/cavemoa/Feather-M0-Adalogger/tree/master/SimpleSleepUSB
Note: you will need to close and re-open your serial monitor each time the M0 wakes up

Iridium 9603 is interfaced to Adalogger using Serial2
D6 (Port A Pin 20) = Enable (Sleep) : Connect to 9603 ON/OFF Pin 5
D10 (Port A Pin 18) = Serial2 TX : Connect to 9603 Pin 6
D12 (Port A Pin 19) = Serial2 RX : Connect to 9603 Pin 7
A3 / D17 (Port A Pin 4) = Network Available : Connect to 9603 Pin 19
Iridium 9603 is powered from Linear Technology LTC3225 SuperCapacitor Charger
(fitted with 2 x 1F 2.7V caps e.g. Bussmann HV0810-2R7105-R)
to provide the 1.3A peak current when the 9603 is transmitting
http://www.linear.com/product/LTC3225
http://www.linear.com/product/LTC3225#demoboards
D5 (Port A Pin 15) = LTC3225 ~Shutdown
A1 / D15 (Port B Pin 8) = LTC3225 PGOOD
Connect LTC3225 VIN to Adalogger VBAT
Connect LTC3225 GND to Adalogger GND
Connect LTC3225 VOUT to Iridium 9603 EXT_PWR Pin 1 + 2
Connect LTC3225 GND to Iridium 9603 EXT_GND Pin 3 + 4
Connect 9603 RTS Pin 13 to SIG_GND Pin 18 (9603 won't communicate without this)
Connect 9603 DTR Pin 14 to SIG_GND Pin 15 (9603 won't communicate without this)

Ultimate GPS is interfaced to Adalogger using Serial1
D1 (Port A Pin 10) = Serial1 TX : Connect to GPS RX
D0 (Port A Pin 11) = Serial1 RX : Connect to GPS TX
D11 (Port A Pin 16) = GPS ENable : Connect to GPS EN(ABLE)
Connect Ultimate GPS VIN to Adalogger VBAT
Connect Ultimate GPS GND to Adalogger GND
Connect Ultimate GPS VBAT to Adalogger 3V (no need for a CR1220 backup battery)

Adalogger has a built-in SD card slot
D22 (Port A Pin 12) = MISO : Connected to SD Card
D23 (Port B Pin 10) = MOSI : Connected to SD Card
D24 (Port B Pin 11) = SCK : Connected to SD Card

MPL3115A2 Pressure (Altitude) and Temperature Sensor
D20 (Port A Pin 22) = SDA : Connect to MPL3115A2 SDA
D21 (Port A Pin 23) = SCL : Connect to MPL3115A2 SCL
Connect MPL3115A2 VCC/Vin to Ultimate GPS 3.3Vout (so GPS_EN can disable both GPS and MPL3115A2 to save power)
Connect MPL3115A2 GND to Adalogger GND

More Adalogger pins
D13 (Port A Pin 17) = Red LED
D9 (Port A Pin 7) = AIN 7 : Battery Voltage / 2
D8 (Port A Pin 6) = Green LED
D16 / A2 (Port B Pin 9) : Reserve for (e.g.) DS3231 RTC Featherwing Interrupt

If you are using the LTC3225 demo circuit (1220B):
Set VOUT_SELECT to 4.8V (Connect VSEL to GND)
Set ICHRG to 150mA (Connect PROG to GND via 15k in parallel with 60.4k)
Remove the Run/SHDN link (the Adalogger controls the SHDN pin)
Remove the 0.25F low profile capacitor from the rear of the PCB
Fit two (e.g.) Bussmann HV0810-2R7105-R 1F 2.7V caps in OPT C3 and OPT C4
There is no thermal relief on the OPT C4 GND pin and it can be difficult to solder
You might have to link the cap leg to the low profile cap negative pad instead
